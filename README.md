# This study investigates the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for Chinese short text topic classification tasks. The key innovations of the proposed model are as follows:
## Leveraging the Skip-gram word embedding model to construct document feature representations, and employing a TextCNN for news topic classification. The model is applied to a Chinese news headline dataset, consisting of short text samples.
## Optimizing the TextCNN network architecture by increasing the convolutional dimensionality, and incorporating K-top pooling operations to enhance the extraction of continuous features.
### Folder _net_ contains files related to TextCNN, while others are attempts to employ LDA model for this task.
